List of questions and responses.


Should we keep questions and comments in a separate file and
not in the code itself?  I'm afraid the code will get messy
and makes merging more difficult. New questions should go on
top of the current text file?  Do you agree?


The function grid.fit.x is not working, I think because the
 function make.fit is based on a count of 419, which means
 model.X <- list()  
  for(j in 1:length(all.baseline.counts.X)){
      model.X[[j]] <- make.fit(all.baseline.counts.X[[j]], loghistMean.X[[j]], tx, week.of.year, log(totpop),time.unit = "week", distribution="poisson")
  }

###  NOT SOLVING all.grid.seasonal.X is wrong length
  grid.fit.X <- list(); all.grid.exp.mean.X <- list()  
  for(j in 1:length(projects)){
      grid.fit.X[[j]]  <- glm(all.grid.counts.X[[j]]  ~ all.grid.logpop +log(all.grid.seasonal.X[[j]]), family="poisson")
      all.grid.exp.mean.X[[j]] <- predict.glm(grid.fit.X[[j]] ,type="response", se.fit=TRUE,newdata=as.data.frame(all.grid.seasonal.X[[j]]))
  }
