List of questions and responses.


Nov 13th.  Maybe good if we go though the code one step at a
time.  In the section "Read COUNT data", specifically in the
section "prepare count- vectors for grid points", we match
communities in compare commune.level and communities in
neighbors.Communities and pull out the date.  What is the
significance of date_decl?  I understand that you need the
base counts of syndromes, but here we're not recording a
count, but a date.  Where are the base data actually
recorded?  

Nov 12th. Should we keep questions and comments in a separate file and
not in the code itself?  I'm afraid the code will get messy
and makes merging more difficult. New questions should go on
top of the current text file?  Do you agree?


The function grid.fit.x is not working, I think because the
 function make.fit is based on a count of 419, which means
 model.X <- list()  
  for(j in 1:length(all.baseline.counts.X)){
      model.X[[j]] <- make.fit(all.baseline.counts.X[[j]], loghistMean.X[[j]], tx, week.of.year, log(totpop),time.unit = "week", distribution="poisson")
  }

###  NOT SOLVING all.grid.seasonal.X is wrong length
  grid.fit.X <- list(); all.grid.exp.mean.X <- list()  
  for(j in 1:length(projects)){
      grid.fit.X[[j]]  <- glm(all.grid.counts.X[[j]]  ~ all.grid.logpop +log(all.grid.seasonal.X[[j]]), family="poisson")
      all.grid.exp.mean.X[[j]] <- predict.glm(grid.fit.X[[j]] ,type="response", se.fit=TRUE,newdata=as.data.frame(all.grid.seasonal.X[[j]]))
  }
